========== INTEGRITY ASSISTANT LAUNCHER ==========

PASSWORD FOR THIS ZIP FILE: integrity2025

==== GETTING STARTED (JUST 2 STEPS!) ====

1. EXTRACT THIS ZIP FILE:
   - Right-click the zip file
   - Select "Extract All..." 
   - When prompted, enter: integrity2025
   - Click "Extract"

2. RUN THE PROGRAM:
   - Double-click "run_integrity.bat"
   - That's it! Everything else happens automatically

==== WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION ====

Our completely redesigned launcher now:
- Works perfectly with Python 3.13.2 and all earlier versions
- Provides detailed progress updates during installation
- Selects the appropriate NumPy version based on your Python version
- Uses only pre-compiled binary packages to avoid build errors
- Creates a desktop shortcut for easy future access
- Verifies each dependency is working before proceeding
- Provides multiple fallback options if a package fails to install
- Gives clear, actionable error messages if something goes wrong

==== COMPATIBLE PYTHON VERSIONS ====

Integrity Assistant works with Python 3.8 and newer, with these compatibility notes:
• Python 3.8-3.10: Best compatibility with all dependencies
• Python 3.11-3.12: Good compatibility with newer package versions
• Python 3.13+: Full support with latest dependency versions

If you have multiple Python versions installed, the script will automatically
detect which one you're using and install the appropriate package versions.

==== INSTALLATION DETAILS ====

The installation process:
1. Detects your Python version and selects compatible packages
2. Creates a dedicated installation directory at %USERPROFILE%\IntegrityAssistant
3. Sets up a clean virtual environment to avoid conflicts
4. Installs compatible versions of all dependencies
5. Creates a desktop shortcut for easy access
6. Verifies each package can be imported correctly
7. Launches the application when everything is ready

Future launches will be much faster using the desktop shortcut!

==== TROUBLESHOOTING ====

Our new installer provides detailed error messages, but here are some common issues:

• If you see a Windows Security warning:
  Click "More info" and then "Run anyway"

• If Python isn't installed:
  The launcher will open the Python download page for you
  Be sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

• If your antivirus interferes:
  Add the extracted folder to your antivirus exceptions

• If you see "Failed to install NumPy" on Python 3.13+:
  The installer will try alternative approaches automatically
  If all fail, consider installing Python 3.10 which has better compatibility

• If EasyOCR fails to install:
  The launcher will attempt to install core functionality
  OCR features may be limited, but core app functions will work

• If the application crashes after starting:
  - Check the detailed error messages in the console
  - Try running the desktop shortcut as administrator
  - Verify installation status in %USERPROFILE%\IntegrityAssistant

Thank you for trying the Integrity Assistant!

==== TECHNICAL DETAILS ====

Integrity Assistant creates a Python virtual environment in the installation folder to ensure it doesn't interfere with other Python applications on your system. The installation process installs these packages:

- requests: For API communication
- customtkinter: For the modern user interface
- numpy: For numerical operations
- opencv-python: For image processing
- easyocr: For optical character recognition

All dependencies use specific versions to ensure compatibility. The installation process has been improved to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback when issues occur.

If you're a developer and want to modify the installation process, you can edit run_integrity.bat to customize it for your needs.

==== CLEANUP SCRIPT ====

The cleanup script (`cleanup_repository.ps1`) is a PowerShell script I created to help you organize your repository. It doesn't automatically delete files (for safety), but rather:

1. Creates a proper directory structure
2. Checks if essential files exist
3. Creates a package template for your application
4. Lists files that can be safely removed
5. Provides instructions for creating the final package

The script hasn't run automatically - you need to execute it manually. Here's how:

1. Open PowerShell in your repository directory
2. Run the script with:
   ```
   .\cleanup_repository.ps1
   ```

When you run it, you'll see colored output showing:
- Which essential files are present/missing
- A new `package-template` folder with the proper structure
- A list of files that can be safely removed
- Step-by-step instructions for creating your final package

If you want the script to actually delete unnecessary files, you'll need to edit it and uncomment these lines near the end:

```powershell
# Uncomment these lines when you're ready to actually delete files
# foreach ($pattern in $removableFiles) {
#     Remove-Item -Path $pattern -Force -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# }
# if (Test-Path "downloads") { 
#     Remove-Item -Path "downloads" -Force -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# }
```

Would you like me to modify the script to automatically delete the unnecessary files, or would you prefer to run it first to see what it reports?
