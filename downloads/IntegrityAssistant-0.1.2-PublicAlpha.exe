Integrity Assistant is distributed as a ZIP file containing the necessary 
Python scripts and installation files rather than as a single executable.

To install Integrity Assistant:

1. Download the appropriate ZIP file from the website:
   - For Windows: integrity-assistant-windows.zip
   - For macOS: integrity-assistant-macos.zip
   - For Linux: integrity-assistant-linux.zip

2. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice

3. Run the appropriate installer:
   - Windows: IntegrityAssistant.bat or install.bat
   - macOS/Linux: IntegrityAssistant.sh or install.sh

This approach allows for more flexibility and compatibility across different
system configurations while ensuring that the application has access to all
necessary dependencies.
